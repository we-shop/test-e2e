Hello user,

here is how to make use of this project.

-Executing tests-

The simplest way to run the test is to run everything that is available by means of:

npm test

But you can also run a sub-set of tests by doing this:

npm run <scope name>

Scopes are listed in package.json > scripts block. Everything listed in this block are names for the supported scopes (except for 'test', it is for running everything as explained at the previous step)


-Slippery ground-

Since dashes are not really legal in javascript, when we receive a json with dashes, jsonpath may not be too happy about it. Here is houw to work around it:

'$["access-token"]'

You can see detailed examples in tests belonging to oauth scope
